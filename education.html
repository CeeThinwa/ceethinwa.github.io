            <div class="intro">My education is a blend of self-taught and traditional education.</div>

                    <h2>Traditional</h2>
                    <p>Regarding my traditional education, I entered the University of Nairobi in 2012 and left in 2016
                         with a Bachelor of Commerce, Marketing option degree. During this time, my interest in
                         entrepreneurship and the informal sector was sparked.</p>
                    <p>I then pursued a professional certification in marketing, CIM, in 2018, where I specialized in
                         Digital Marketing. It was there where I saw the important role that digital platforms and the
                         Internet play in helping businesses succeed, and I chose to further specialize in research and
                         analytics.</p>
                    <p>I returned to the University of Nairobi in 2019, but this time studying a Master of Science in
                         Social Statistics degree. It is here where I gained a solid statistical foundation, strengthening
                         my research and analytics capabilities.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <h2>Non-Traditional</h2>
                    <p>During my time in university, I got to travel a lot and learn more about the informal sector in 3
                         different countries in addition to Kenya. Something that struck me at the time was that a lot of
                         research was not usually led by local communities, and there was little public data available for
                         local businesses to leverage.</p>
                    <p>Out of university and back home in 2018, I first came across the term data science and saw that it
                         involved use of a programming language called Python. Someone I met at an event also pointed me
                         to some data science meetups in Nairobi. They were AI Kenya, Master Cohorts and Women in Machine
                         Learning and Data Science Kenya. These forums exposed me to in-person hackathons, learning
                         programs and open-source resources.</p>
                    <p>During late 2018, I learned Python using CodeAcademy while guided by the open-source Python learning
                         path given by Andela at the time. Basic Python knowledge enabled me to participate in a continental
                         program that trained aspiring data scientists in partnership with Microsoft. The Microsoft
                         Professional Program in Data Science was a wonderful bridge that enabled me to transition from
                         an Arts degree and enter into STEM.</p>
                    <p>2020 was a year that I got to plug into virtual communities and virtual global events, such as
                         Data Science for Social Good Community, Data Umbrella Scikit-Learn sprint and AI for Good UK
                         community. While in these global spaces, I applied for and got into two programs.</p>
                    <p>The first was the 2021 Delta Analytics Teaching Fellowship where I got to learn teaching techniques
                         for technical (Data Science, Machine Learning, AI) concepts. Sometime later, I got into Bootcamp
                         33, a 3-month program organised by Prospect 33 that trained me to apply data science in the
                         context of the banking industry.</p>
                    <p>In these two places, I was able to get technical mentorship around:</p>
                    <p>data science in production,<br>
                        teaching mixed audiences,<br>
                        presenting on a livestream,<br>
                        leveraging graph databases to detect financial fraud, and<br>
                        automating data annotation where the text data has code-switching.</p>
