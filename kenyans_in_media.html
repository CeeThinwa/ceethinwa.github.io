                <h2>Kenyans on Twitter</h2>
                <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                <p>Kenya is a linguistically diverse country with over 40+ languages, but current NLP solutions
                    serving her inhabitants do not capture this linguistic diversity. Furthermore, many Kenyans
                    code-switch, particularly in informal settings and this requires a fresh approach to conducting
                    NLP tasks on data generated by Kenyans.</p>
                <p>The aim of this project was therefore to build a Natural Language Processing solution for multilingual,
                    code-switching cultures, using sentiment analysis on Kenyan social media data as a use case.
                    The data used was all tweets containing #KOT written during 1st June 2020 - 1st June 2021; #KOT is a
                    hashtag that Kenyans on Twitter typically use to identify themselves. A problem-solving and 
                    project management framework, the NLP toolbox, was used to come up with this solution.</p>

                <h2>Kenyans on Print</h2>
                <p>In this case, stories of Kenyans and Kenyan residents were collected from a local<br>
                    newspaper written by Kenyan reporters. The stories were mostly positive, and they<br>
                    explored some of the realities and life circumstances that the story subjects<br>
                    experienced.</p>
