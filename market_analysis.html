                    <p>I am happy to have been born and raised in Kenya, and it is the place that I call home.</p>
                    <p>I was inspired to use my skills to tell data driven stories from a Kenyan perspective because:</p>
                    <p>Kenya is incredibly diverse, with almost 50 communities,<br>
                        it is an emerging economy that is yet to be fully understood,<br>
                        most of its languages are low resource, and<br>
                        it is not that common to find balanced reporting about Kenya.</p>
