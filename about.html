                    <h2>My Work</h2>
                    <p>I enjoy simplifying hard technical concepts and deploying machine learning models in the real
                         world. This inspired my first website, <a href="https://applysocialstats.com">
                            applysocialstats.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>I am currently a final year Master of Science in Social Statistics at the University of Nairobi,
                         conducting econometric research on Kenyaâ€™s informal sector. I also recently completed a Machine
                         Learning Teaching Fellowship, which has grown my Natural Language Processing capabilities.</p>
                    <p>My project management skills, honed over the past 3 years, ensure that projects that I am
                         involved in get done well and completed on time.</p>
                    <p>I have feature engineered numeric and text data. These features have been used to run models that
                         are not only evaluated based on scientific metrics like variance and accuracy, but also
                         considering organization goals, organizational resources and speed of compute.</p>
                    <p>Great data is the foundation to a great model. I am comfortable working in a team setting, being
                         able to adapt to different personalities and show empathy.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to demonstrating my capabilities and building scalable machine learning solutions
                         to grow your organization for years to come.</p>

                    <p>I am a Christian - a follower of Christ, and my goal is to glorify God in everything I say and
                         do.</p>
                    <p><em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should
                         not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the
                         world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</em><br>John 3:16-17 (ESV)</p>
