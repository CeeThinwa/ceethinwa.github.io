                        <p>Hello!</p>
                        <p>I am passionate about impactful marketing research
                            through data science and machine learning.
                            As a result, I enjoy simplifying hard technical concepts
                            and deploying machine learning models in the real world.</p>
                        <p>I am currently a final year Master of Science in Social Statistics
                            at the University of Nairobi, conducting econometric research
                            on Kenyaâ€™s informal sector. I also recently completed a
                            Machine Learning Teaching Fellowship, which has grown my
                            Natural Language Processing capabilities.</p>
                        <p>My project management skills, honed over the past 3 years,
                            ensure that projects that I am involved in get done well and
                            completed on time.</p>
                        <p>I have feature engineered numeric and text data. These features have been
                            used to run models that are not only evaluated based on scientific metrics
                            like variance and accuracy, but also considering organization goals,
                            organizational resources and speed of compute.</p>
                        <p>Great data is the foundation to a great model. I am comfortable working in a
                            team setting, being able to adapt to different personalities
                            and show empathy.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to demonstrating my capabilities and building
                            scalable machine learning solutions to grow your organization
                            for years to come.</p></div>
