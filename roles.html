                        <h2>COVER LETTER</h2>
                        <p>Hello!</p>
                        <p>I am passionate about impactful marketing research<br>
                            through data science and machine learning.<br>
                            As a result, I enjoy simplifying hard technical concepts<br>
                            and deploying machine learning models in the real world.</p>
                        <p>I am currently a final year Master of Science in Social Statistics<br>
                            at the University of Nairobi, conducting econometric research<br>
                            on Kenyaâ€™s informal sector. I also recently completed a<br>
                            Machine Learning Teaching Fellowship, which has grown my<br>
                            Natural Language Processing capabilities.</p>
                        <p>My project management skills, honed over the past 3 years,<br>
                            ensure that projects that I am involved in get done well and<br>
                            completed on time. In my role within the AI & Blockchain department<br>
                            at my former employer, I built the first customer segmentation solution<br>
                            for a Kenyan company, and advocated for its adoption by<br>
                            Operations and Management.</p>
                        <p>I have also mined data from public sites, and also feature engineered<br>
                            numeric and text data. These features have been used to run models<br>
                            that are not only evaluated based on scientific metrics like<br>
                            variance and accuracy, but also considering organization goals,<br>
                            organizational resources and speed of compute.</p>
                        <p>Great data is the foundation to a great model. I have quite a number of<br>
                            Jupyter Notebooks where I have done exploratory data analysis.
                            In <a href="https://applysocialstats.com">my app</a>, I have been able to create<br>
                            an SQLite database and deploy it in production.<br>
                            I can also use tools like Streamlit to quickly deploy models in the real world.</p>
                        <p> I am familiar with finding and evaluating datasets online for<br>
                            personal projects; therefore I am confident<br>
                            that I can do the same for you.</p>
                        <p>I am comfortable working in a team setting, being able to adapt<br>
                            to different personalities and listen and show empathy to fellow team members.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to demonstrating my capabilities and building<br>
                            scalable machine learning solutions to grow your organization<br>
                            for years to come.</p>
