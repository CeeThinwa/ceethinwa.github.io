# Welcome to my Portfolio!

*I am passionate about impactful marketing research through Machine Learning & Data Science.*

**MY BIG QUESTION: How can we make more organizations competitive and sustainable?**

The world of people is complex and I’m here to use data to make sense of it all using compelling stories online.

I use machine learning and data science to solve tough problems that the organizations of today face, be they big or small. I use data visualizations and presentations to make hard technical concepts simple.

I blend HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, R, Markdown and PowerBI with copywriting, design, public speaking and teaching skills.

I’m open to research and data positions; let’s talk opportunities at [ceethinwa@gmail.com](mailto:ceethinwa@gmail.com).

## Data Science Projects
### Assessing Welfare of KIVA Borrowers

In this project, I sought to estimate the welfare level of KIVA borrowers. The objective was to pair Kiva's 2014-2018 data with additional data sources to estimate welfare level in specific regions, based on shared economic and demographic characteristics.

#### Research Conclusions

***The impact of KIVA donors***

1. *93.3% of loans were financed by KIVA, with USD 225 being the most common amount*
2. *The most valuable partnerships are those with social impact businesses, which implies that they are able to hanle regular payments as they make an income from their goods and services*
3. *Kenya and the Phillipines have a lot of funding for small loans*

***Welfare of KIVA borrowers***

*The welfare of borrowers that received the largest amount of funding on Kiva can be viewed as good because:*

* *Women form the bulk of the borrowers and they receive the highest number of funds, even as they have the highest shortfall*
* *Countries like Peru and El Salvador which based on the data have low MPI scores have received a lot of funding*
* *Few borrowers are taking loans for personal use*
* *Massive impact is being achieved for Kenyan men and Filipino women, because the loans are small enough to pay back and monthly repayments are taking up only 50% or less of their monthly income*

*With that said, it is concerning to see that countries that have many more people in need are not accessing large amounts of funds; furthermore, even when they do, places like Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and Mali had a high debt burden, trapping borrowers from these countries in poverty.*

### Traits of a Marketing Researcher

The goal of this research is to help job-seekers seeking to work in the niche area of marketing research to gain a clear and current understanding of how they should package themselves to become attractive to the "global" employer. Research was based on data obtained from Indeed.com in January 2020.

#### Research Conclusions

***Parts of Speech***

*Nouns tended to give the most complete information compared to verbs or pronouns when used in n-grams.*

***Traits of a Marketing Researcher***

* *Soft skills were emphasised by recruiters as qualities they were looking for compared to technical skills*
* *Recruiters were seeking someone who has had hands-on marketing experience in the past*
* *Candidates with 3 years of experience were most sought after*
